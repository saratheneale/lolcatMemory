Picking up May 2019 
- Fixed URL. Remembered how tf to fetch and display data :) 
- Next - make pairs to restore the game. 

Today

accomplished timing of unmatched flip.
successfully navigate matched, unmatched, winner states. oneFlipped state needs detailing.
Check for winner. 

Bugs
- click too fast, things are unstable. Turn off events when processing. 
- Got a mismatched pair. Not sure if this is clicking too fast or if I need to destroy the card in oneFlipped on exit. If I destroy that card, where will I store its data in the meantime?

Next
-Work click too fast
-polish oneFlipped state. 
- Confetti
- memoryAppView should know when it has a winner and pop up congrats
- maybe make flipped cards have tranparent tile?, animate them in?
Figure out how to push to gh-pages branch. ergh.
