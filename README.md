lolcatMemory
============

A memory game with Lolcat tiles. 

 Classic Memory tile game with randomly generated LolCat images. This was a Girl Develop It pair up programming exercise. Since then, I've converted it to other frameworks.

 Version 1 navigates the DOM with plain JavaScript. 
 Version 2 uses Backbone.js and its dependencies- jquery, underscore. 
 Version 3 hopes to use Marionette or maybe Require.js.
